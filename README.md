This repository contains implementations of single linked lists, double linked lists, and circular linked lists in C programming language. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used for storing and managing collections of elements.

## Implemented Linked List Types:

1. **Single Linked List**:
   - A single linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. It is a linear data structure.

2. **Double Linked List**:
   - A double linked list is similar to a single linked list, but each node contains an additional reference (pointer) to the previous node in the sequence, enabling traversal in both forward and backward directions.

3. **Circular Linked List**:
   - A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. It can be implemented as a single circular linked list or a double circular linked list.
